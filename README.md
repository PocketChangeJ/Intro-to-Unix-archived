## Introduction to shell and high-performance computing (HPC)

### Description

This repository has teaching materials for a 2-day introduction to the shell, high-performance computing with a brief introduction to RNA-sequencing data analysis. It is intended to give participants without any computational skills the ability to effectively use a high-performance compute environment ([HMS-RC]()) to analyze data. This workshop focuses on implementing the workflow to analyze RNA-seq data, starting with raw FASTQ data and ending with generation of count data. 

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop, but also amenable to self-guided learning.

### Audience
Biologists

Computational skills: Beginner/Intermediate

### Prerequisite
None

### Duration
2-day workshop (~13 hours of trainer-led time)
